# Lane `omar-abdelkafy`: progress

Lane document: [`docs/agents/lanes/omar-abdelkafy.md`](../agents/lanes/omar-abdelkafy.md). Method: [`docs/agents/audio-video-harvest.md`](../agents/audio-video-harvest.md).

## Next step

Write prose from the pilot transcripts (`pass5-qwen`, the working engine), as the founder authorised on 25 Oct 2026; the extraction agent's output is pending checks and commit.

## Done

- 25 Oct 2026: pilot transcripts finished for episodes 1–4 (`~/islam-museum-harvest/books/assabile/omar-abdelkafy/aadau-al-islam/`, with `.json`, `.txt` and `.meta.json`).

- 25 Oct 2026: archive probed in the built-in browser. 25 series, about 620 lessons (7 video, 18 audio). Episode pages carry titles and durations and a direct MP3 link (`media.assabile.com`). robots.txt does not disallow the lesson pages or the media host; no licence statement found on the site.
- 25 Oct 2026: pilot downloaded: `aadau-al-islam` episodes 1–4 (SHA-256 in `~/islam-museum-harvest/raw/assabile/omar-abdelkafy/aadau-al-islam/SHA256SUMS`). Audio is 8 kbit/s mono, 8 kHz.
- 25 Oct 2026: transcription model measured on episode 1 (44 min): `whisper-large-v3-turbo` about 60 s, visibly weaker Arabic; `whisper-large-v3` (mlx) about 3 min 15 s. Default set to large-v3.
- 25 Oct 2026: `data/source/assabile-omar-abdelkafy.yaml` registered; `scripts/harvest/audio/download.py` and `transcribe.py` written.

## Doubts in the record

- Transcript quality: the working engine's output is noisy (garbled and invented lines) and does not agree with the large-v3 pass on most windows. Used as authorised by the founder on 25 Oct 2026; unclear lines dropped, single-occurrence names and numbers marked `needs_source`.
- Birth year: the archive's biography says "labour day of 1952"; English Wikipedia and Wikidata say 1 May 1951. Both kept; the record shows the conflict (not yet written into the person record; to do in the first prose batch).
- The archive lists his name as Omar AbdelKafy and Omar Abdelkafi; the record keeps Omar Abd al-Kafi / Abdelkafy as the label.

## Completed recordings (report per `audio-video-harvest.md` §8)

| Recording | Duration | Prose | Persons | Places | Events | Other entities | Claims verified | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| none completed yet | | | | | | | | |

Downloaded and transcribed, not completed: `aadau-al-islam` episodes 1–4 (transcripts only; verification in progress).

## Excluded items (standing rule, founder's instruction, 25 Oct 2026)

Every enrichment, prose passage, claim or entity that is dropped or left out must be listed here, with:
- **Item:** the entity, sentence or line (with its episode and timestamp).
- **Reason:** what was wrong with it (unclear transcript line, garbled name or number, conflict with another source, outside the lane's scope, and so on).
- **Gate failed:** the rule it did not meet (for example "unclear transcript", "single occurrence, name garbled", "no citation resolves", "schema check").
- **Override:** `open` until the founder authorises re-entry; then `re-entered by founder authorisation (date)` or `kept excluded`.

Nothing is re-entered without the founder's written authorisation.

| Item | Episode / time | Reason | Gate failed | Override |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pilot windows excluded by the two-engine check: 1 of 205 agreed across ep01–ep04 (about 99.5% excluded) | aadau-al-islam ep01–ep04 (ep02 has MP3 decoder warnings) | Qwen and large-v3 gave different words for the same audio | Two-engine agreement check (per 60 s window) | Re-entered by founder authorisation (25 Oct 2026): all four pilot episodes are included from the working engine's output. |
| Transcript lines the extraction agent did not use (Aadau Al Islam, Qwen pass): about 82 of 408 lines by a repetition heuristic (an estimate, not a hand count); 13 further points kept as `needs_source` annotations, not exclusions | aadau-al-islam ep01–ep04 | Garbled or repeated text, unclear in context | Clarity judgement by the agent (no gate number); the heuristic count is only an estimate | Open. Lines are retrievable from the Qwen transcripts; re-entry needs your authorisation. |
| Al Hoquq, 268 windows garbled or unclear in context (the earlier "off-topic" label is withdrawn; founder, 25 Oct 2026: any intelligible topic is included) (ep01 65, ep02 46, ep03 41, ep04 60, ep05 56) | al-hoquq ep01–ep05 | Clear Arabic that makes sense in context | Clarity judgement by the extraction agent | Open |
| Re-entry authorised by the founder (25 Oct 2026): included as the speaker's view, tagged contested (`sensitivity: contested` and a `:::perspectives` block). Al Hoquq, 56 windows on contested matters, previously held back (ep01 00:03:00–00:03:30; 00:10:00–00:12:30; 00:21:00. ep02 00:14:00–00:14:30; 00:16:00; 00:28:30–00:30:00; 00:42:00–00:42:30. ep03 00:12:00–00:13:00; 00:16:30–00:21:30; 00:36:00–00:38:30. ep04 00:12:00–00:17:30; 00:26:00–00:27:30; 00:46:30–00:47:30. ep05 00:13:30–00:17:00) | al-hoquq | A perspectives block needs a cited Sunni source and an academic source; none held for these | Missing sources for the perspectives block | Open. Re-entry needs a cited Sunni and academic source, then your authorisation. |
| Al Hoquq, 41 repetition loops or non-sentences | al-hoquq ep01–ep05 | Reads as a non-sentence | Automatic detection | Open |
| Al Hoquq, 15 supplications and formulae | al-hoquq ep01–ep05 | Not a fact | Content rule: facts only | Open |
| Re-entry authorised by the founder (25 Oct 2026): added, with needs_source where unverifiable. Al Hoquq, dropped points inside cited windows: ep05 00:08:00–00:08:30 (aqiqa at an advanced age, unclear; a medical claim about teeth, unsupported); ep03 00:16:30, 00:17:30, 00:37:00–00:37:30 (single-occurrence figures 1920, 1930, 200 million, 73 million dollars, 180 dollars); ep05 00:38:30 (a smoking figure from an unnamed study); ep02 00:37:00 (Qur'an reference 24:3, unclear context); ep01 00:29:30 (Qur'an reference 33:36, contested use) | as listed | Garbled single figures, unverifiable or unclear claims, contested use | Single occurrence, garbled; unverifiable; unclear context; contested | Open |

Names and numbers spoken once (for example a count of ten children, age fourteen, seven years of discipline, the aqiqa days, six rights) are kept as `needs_source` annotations, not excluded.

## Decision on exclusions (founder, 25 Oct 2026)

- Everything the speaker says that is intelligible is included, on any topic. Nothing is dropped as "off-topic". The earlier "off-topic" label is withdrawn.
- Garbled or unclear windows are not written as content. They are flagged for re-listening or re-transcription, and the founder may override.
- Repetition loops are not content and stay excluded.
- Contested windows are included as the speaker's own view, labelled as his view. The academic and other views are marked "not yet sourced" until cited sources exist.
- Recited formulae are included when the speaker explains them. The recitation itself is never typed.

## Batch log

- Batch 0 (25 Oct 2026, commit on branch `claude/harvest-omar-abdel-kafi-content-81375c`): method document, scripts, lane document, source entity, registry and engineering-doc updates; person record `person/omar-abdelkafy` enriched in ar, en and ur with the archive's biography conflict (birth 1951 against 1952) and the archive's list of 25 series (622 lessons) under `source/assabile-omar-abdelkafy`. Sources: the archive's own pages (biography, series index), not transcripts. Checks: `npm run validate` 0 errors, `npm test` 13 of 13 files pass, `npm run cite-check -- person/omar-abdelkafy` pass, `npm run coverage` regenerated.
- Pilot transcripts (outside git): `aadau-al-islam` episodes 1–4, large-v3, about 13 times real time. Used for no prose yet.
