## First book: al-Qanun fi al-Tibb (Ibn Sina)

- **Source file (local, not in git):** `/Users/ahmedabdelaal/Downloads/القانون في الطب_63329_Foulabook.com_.pdf`, copied to `raw/library/medicine-science/canon-ibn-sina/canon-ibn-sina.pdf` on the harvest drive. 1,161 pages, 6.9 MB, Arabic printed edition. Its own text layer exists but is partly broken, so the whole book is OCR'd with Apple Vision (`--force-ocr`).
- **Edition:** not verified yet (no publisher, date or volume on the title page we have read). Must be checked before the source is marked reviewed.
- **Category:** `medicine-science` is not in the category list of `books.yaml`; it is a harvest folder name only. Founder to confirm.
- **OCR:** started 18 Oct 2026 with `ocr_book.py --force-ocr`, log `logs/ocr-canon-ibn-sina.log`.

## Canon print volumes (user-supplied, 18 Oct 2026)

- Volume 1: https://archive.org/details/alqanun-iiibn-sina1 (raw/library/medicine-science/canon-ibn-sina-print-v1/)
- Volume 2: https://archive.org/details/alqanun-iiibn-sina2 (raw/library/medicine-science/canon-ibn-sina-print-v2/)
- Volume 3: https://archive.org/details/alqanun-iiibn-sina3 (raw/library/medicine-science/canon-ibn-sina-print-v3/)
- Queued for OCR after the current items. The front matter and the five-book division are expected in these volumes; the earlier 1,161-page OCR has none. Edition details come from the printed title pages.
- Source for future downloads: https://www.al-mostafa.com/ (requested by the founder). Not yet checked for licence or terms; not added to any fetch step.

## Next step

Add this lane's entries to `scripts/harvest/library/books.yaml` in the lane's own commit, then run `fetch_books.py` for the lane after the workstream commit is on `origin/main`.
