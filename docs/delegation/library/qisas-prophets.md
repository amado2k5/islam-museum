## Duplicates found and skipped

None recorded yet. Pre-check counts (18 Oct 2026, `grep -ril` over `data/`) are in the lane document.

## Downloads

Pre-download record. Each file is named by its archive.org identifier; the titles were checked only by the fetcher's token match, so each one must be confirmed against the book before OCR.

## Download status (18 Oct 2026)

- Run stopped by the coordinator, not finished: 75 download attempts started; 0 `FAILED` lines; 0 new rows in `library/manifest.jsonl` (966 file rows before and after). The attempts re-fetched files already on the drive, so the run was stopped.
- `fetch_books.py` now skips a book with a downloaded file and skips a file already on disk. Not yet committed.
- Books with no candidate found: see the lane's Downloads section.

## Next step

Add this lane's entries to `scripts/harvest/library/books.yaml` in the lane's own commit, then run `fetch_books.py` for the lane after the workstream commit is on `origin/main`.
